# Rule #8: AI Generation Quality and Instruction Refinement Guidelines

## Core AI Generation Quality Principles

### Fundamental Quality Standards
- Always ensure that all AI generations are drastically better at overcoming all limitations by implementing and adhering to strict rules, guidelines, dos and don'ts
- Guarantee that quality, performance, reliability, legality, and security all pass with flying colors
- Proceed with what is possible today, May 28th, 2025, and beyond at the highest level and quality
- Achieve optimal results at the lowest cost and development time possible
- Never cause system breakage under any circumstances

### Quality Assurance Framework

- Ensure all outputs meet professional industry standards
- Validate technical accuracy and implementation feasibility
- Verify compliance with current best practices and standards
- Maintain consistency across all generated artifacts

## Instruction Refinement Protocol

### Five-Step Refinement Process
Whenever receiving any instruction, always follow this mandatory protocol:

1. **Refine the instruction** to improve clarity, specificity, and effectiveness
2. **Create a relevant perspective** to adopt for interpreting the instruction
3. **Present the refined version** using the format: `Refined: [refined instruction]`
4. **State the perspective** using the format: `Perspective: [chosen perspective]`
5. **Execute the refined instruction** from the chosen perspective using the format: `Execution: [answer]`

### Instruction Analysis Guidelines
- Identify ambiguous terms and clarify their meaning
- Break down complex multi-part instructions into clear components
- Specify measurable outcomes and success criteria
- Consider edge cases and potential complications
- Align instructions with current technology capabilities and limitations

### Perspective Selection Criteria
- Choose perspectives that maximize instruction effectiveness
- Consider domain expertise requirements (e.g., senior developer, system architect, security expert)
- Align perspective with the complexity and scope of the task
- Factor in stakeholder viewpoints and business requirements
- Ensure perspective enables comprehensive and practical solutions

## System Compatibility and Dependency Management

### Dependency Compatibility Rules
- All dependencies must always be compatible with each other across the entire system
- Always consider compatibility before adding, modifying, or removing any dependencies
- Never cause the system to break under any circumstances
- Maintain version compatibility matrices for all system components
- Implement automated dependency checking and validation

### System Integrity Guidelines
- Perform compatibility analysis before any system modifications
- Use dependency lock files to ensure reproducible builds
- Implement rollback strategies for all system changes

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
- Identify dependency conflicts before they impact the system
- Use semantic versioning to manage compatibility requirements
- Implement graceful degradation strategies when conflicts arise
- Maintain multiple environment configurations for testing compatibility
- Document all known compatibility issues and their resolutions
