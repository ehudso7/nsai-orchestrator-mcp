# Project Context

## Current State
The NSAI Orchestrator MCP is a multi-agent system designed for complex task orchestration using the Multi-Component Protocol (MCP).

## Key Capabilities
- Multi-agent coordination through MCP
- Graph-based memory management
- Code execution in secure environments
- Real-time task analysis and optimization
- Web-based monitoring interface

## Active Components
- **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`) - Core protocol server
- **Main Orchestrator** (`main.py`) - Primary entry point
- **Agent Network** - Specialized AI agents for different tasks
- **Memory System** - Persistent graph-based storage
- **Frontend Interface** - Next.js web application

## Development Priorities
1. Agent communication reliability
2. Memory system optimization
3. Error handling and recovery
4. Performance monitoring
5. Security and sandboxing

## Common Operations
- Agent deployment and scaling
- Task workflow design
- Memory graph queries
- Performance analysis
- System health monitoring

## Integration Points
- MCP protocol compliance
- Graph database operations
- LLM API integrations
- Docker containerization
- Web interface communication

## Known Challenges
- Agent synchronization complexity
- Memory consistency across agents
- Error propagation and recovery
- Resource management and scaling
- Cross-agent communication latency
