The NSAI Orchestrator MCP (Multi-Component Protocol) is designed with privacy-by-design principles. This document outlines our data handling practices, privacy protections, and compliance measures.

## 2. Data Collection and Processing

### 2.1 Data Types Processed

The system may process the following types of data:

#### User-Generated Data
- Task descriptions and instructions
